<h2>Who makes up Forever Farms?</h2>
<p>My name is Billy. I am the ceo and youngest one in the company. My parents started the farm, and I turned it into a business. I grew up in the country, hence why I love farm life. My passion for good food is what sparked my interest in selling our own food.</p>

<p>Born and raised on this farm, I loved it but always felt I was missing out. I ventured out of my comfort zone, going to college at Boston College and studying business. Being in the city was a nice experience, but I longed for home. I eventually took my newfound business knowledge and returned back home to the farm to start the family business. 
</p>
<p>
Being a family owned business, everyone who works within our company is family. The oldest is my dad, Jimmy. He was the man tending the farm while I grew up. Next up is my mom, Melissa. She does all the marketing, she is the face of the business. Next up is my sister, Jess. Jess does all of our financing. She covers it all, no numbers ever slip by her.
