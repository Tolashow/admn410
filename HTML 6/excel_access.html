<p>Being on a farm, we tend to shy away from technology...but Microsft excel and access are two things we can not live without. All of our financials are tracked into excel. This is mostly my sister's job, being the financial manager of the company. She tracks, units sold, units produced, fixed costs such as electricity and water, as well as the amount of food used/needed for all the animals. We love how easy excel makes things for us, we better recognize patterns in our business due to excel which saves a lot of time scratching heads wondering if we have enough resources.

Access on the other hand is more used by my mom. She does a ton with sales projections, being the marketing manager of the company. She uses all of the data my sister puts in to help predict how we will do month to month. She also uses references to see how things are linked together and how we would be affected if we cut certain costs or products. Access is more used semiannually when we are checking our progress throughout the year. We use this to make sales projections and ensure we are still on track to hit all of our goals.
